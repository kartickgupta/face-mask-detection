# Face Mask Detection using Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2 Architecture
Easily Deployable to low-end devices like Raspberry-pi and can detect and work on up to 3 faces simultaneously. We used Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2 architecture.

## Libraries & Frameworks used:
**1.** [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

**2.** [OpenCV](https://keras.io/).

**3.** [Keras](https://opencv.org/).

## Prerequisites
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
